# Python-Tasks
#Assignment 1: 
#Task 1 : basic arthmetic program :
 This Python script performs four basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers entered by the user.
Functionality:
Prompts the user to input two numbers.
Calculates:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (handles division by zero gracefully)
- Displays the results with contextual messaging.
Purpose:
This task demonstrates the use of user input, simple calculations, conditional logic, and formatted output in Python. It’s designed to reinforce core programming concepts with real-time feedback.

#Task 2 : user greeting program :
 This Python script prompts the user to input their first and last names, combines them into a full name, and then displays a personalized welcome message.
Functionality:
- Accepts user input for first and last names.
- Concatenates the names with appropriate spacing.
- Outputs a custom greeting using formatted strings.
Purpose:
Designed to introduce string manipulation, user input handling, and basic output formatting in Python—ideal for beginners building interactive console programs.

#Assignment 2: 
#Task 1 : Even or Odd Number Checker
 This Python script determines whether a given integer input by the user is even or odd.
Functionality:
- Accepts an integer from the user.
- Uses an if-else condition to check if the number is divisible by 2.
- Prints a message indicating whether the number is even or odd.
Purpose:
Designed to reinforce basic input handling, conditional logic, and the concept of modulo operations in Python.

#Task 2 : Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
 This Python program calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.
Functionality:
- Iterates through numbers from 1 to 50.
- Accumulates the total using a loop and a sum variable.
- Displays the final result on the console.
Purpose:
Helps understand loops, range-based iteration, and the use of accumulators—core principles in control flow and logic structuring

#Assignment 3: 
#Task 1 : Calculate Factorial Using a Function
 This Python script defines and uses a function to compute the factorial of a given number.
 Functionality:
- Defines a function called factorial() that calculates the factorial using a loop or recursion.
- The function accepts one integer as input and returns its factorial.
- Demonstrates usage by calling the function with a sample value and printing the result.
Purpose:
Introduces the concept of functions, loops/recursion, and modular code design. It’s a fundamental building block for tackling mathematical problems in Python efficiently.

#Task 2 :  Task 2: Mathematical Operations Using the math Module
This script uses Python’s built-in math module to perform multiple calculations on a user-provided number.
Functionality:
- Prompts the user for a numeric input.
- Uses math.sqrt() to compute the square root.
- Uses math.log() to calculate the natural logarithm.
- Uses math.sin() to evaluate the sine of the number (in radians).
- Displays all calculated results with informative labels.
Purpose:
This task demonstrates how to import and use standard modules, particularly for scientific computations, while reinforcing concepts like user input, type conversion, and method calls.

#Assignment 4 : 
#Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
 This Python script reads content from a file named sample.txt and gracefully handles the scenario when the file does not exist.
Functionality:
- Attempts to open and read sample.txt.
- Prints each line of the file if it exists.
- Uses exception handling to catch and display an error message if the file is missing.
Purpose:
Demonstrates basic file reading operations and emphasizes the importance of error handling in Python using try-except blocks.

#Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
 This Python program allows the user to interact with a file named output.txt by writing new input, appending additional content, and then displaying the final result.
 Functionality:
- Takes user input and writes it to output.txt.
- Appends more data to the same file.
- Reads and prints the entire content of output.txt after modifications.
Purpose:
Explores file manipulation through Python’s open() function in write ('w'), append ('a'), and read ('r') modes. It also reinforces understanding of user input, file I/O, and output formatting.
