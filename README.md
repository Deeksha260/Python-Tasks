# Python-Tasks
#Assignment 1: 
#Task 1 : basic arthmetic program :
 This Python script performs four basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers entered by the user.
Functionality:
Prompts the user to input two numbers.
Calculates:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (handles division by zero gracefully)
- Displays the results with contextual messaging.
Purpose:
This task demonstrates the use of user input, simple calculations, conditional logic, and formatted output in Python. It’s designed to reinforce core programming concepts with real-time feedback.

#Task 2 : user greeting program :
 This Python script prompts the user to input their first and last names, combines them into a full name, and then displays a personalized welcome message.
Functionality:
- Accepts user input for first and last names.
- Concatenates the names with appropriate spacing.
- Outputs a custom greeting using formatted strings.
Purpose:
Designed to introduce string manipulation, user input handling, and basic output formatting in Python—ideal for beginners building interactive console programs.

#Assignment 2: 
#Task 1 : Even or Odd Number Checker
 This Python script determines whether a given integer input by the user is even or odd.
Functionality:
- Accepts an integer from the user.
- Uses an if-else condition to check if the number is divisible by 2.
- Prints a message indicating whether the number is even or odd.
Purpose:
Designed to reinforce basic input handling, conditional logic, and the concept of modulo operations in Python.

#Task 2 : Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
 This Python program calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.
Functionality:
- Iterates through numbers from 1 to 50.
- Accumulates the total using a loop and a sum variable.
- Displays the final result on the console.
Purpose:
Helps understand loops, range-based iteration, and the use of accumulators—core principles in control flow and logic structuring
