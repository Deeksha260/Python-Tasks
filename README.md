#Task 1 Python script
This Python script performs four basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers entered by the user.
Functionality:
Prompts the user to input two numbers.
Calculates:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (handles division by zero gracefully)
- Displays the results with contextual messaging.
Purpose:
This task demonstrates the use of user input, simple calculations, conditional logic, and formatted output in Python. It’s designed to reinforce core programming concepts with real-time feedback.
